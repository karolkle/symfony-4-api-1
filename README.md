# symfony-4-api-1

Setup

To get it working, follow these steps:

Download Composer dependencies

Make sure you have Composer installed and then run:

composer install



Start the built-in web server

You can use Apache, but the built-in web server works great:

php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public

Now check out the site at http://localhost:8000

Have fun!
